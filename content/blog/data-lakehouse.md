Choosing Enterprise Data Solution is a key challenge for modern businesses. With the explosion of data in recent years, organizations need to be able to store, manage, and analyze vast amounts of information to gain insights and make informed decisions. Data lakes, data warehouses, and data lakehouses are three popular solutions for managing data, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

## What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores structured, processed data from a variety of sources. It is designed to support business intelligence (BI) analytics and reporting by delivering clean, structured data. Data warehouses are typically built using a schema-on-write approach, where data is pre-processed before being loaded into the warehouse.
Some popular examples of data warehouses include Teradata, Snowflake, Redshift, Big Query, and Synapse Analytics.

## What is a Data Lake?

A data lake is a large, centralized repository that stores raw, unprocessed data of any nature in any format. Unlike a data warehouse, a data lake does not enforce a schema or structure. This makes it suitable for storing massive amounts of data that may not fit into a traditional schema-on-write approach. Many organizations use data lakes for data science and machine learning, but not for BI reporting due to its unvalidated nature. Some popular examples of data lakes include Amazon S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage.

## What is a Data Lakehouse?

A data lakehouse combines the advantages of data lakes and data warehouses. It provides the reliable transactions of a data warehouse and the scalability and low cost of a data lake. A lakehouse allows for a single source of truth, with unified data from all sources.

The data lake table format is the most important component of a lakehouse architecture. There must be some way to organize and manage all the raw data files in the data lake storage. Table formats help abstract the physical data structureâ€™s complexity and allow different engines to work simultaneously on the same data. The table format in a lakehouse architecture facilitates the ability to do data warehouse-level transactions (DML) along with ACID guarantees. Some of the other critical features of a table format are schema evolution, expressive SQL, time travel, and data compaction (i.e. Delta Lake). SparkSQL API can be used as the query engine.

Some popular examples of data lakehouses include Google Big Lake, Databricks Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi.

## Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse

Data warehouse delivers clean, structured data for BI analytics, while a data lake permanently and cheaply stores data of any nature in any format. A data lakehouse combines the advantages of a data warehouse and a data lake, providing reliable transactions, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
