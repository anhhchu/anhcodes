      <description>Spark Architecture Spark Cluster Components Spark Session Spark APIs Computation in Spark Spark Catalyst Optimizer Adaptive Query Execution Shuffle, Partitioning and Caching in Spark Partitioning Shuffle Cache in Spark Most Big Data developers and Data Engineers start learning Spark by writing SparkSQL codes to perform ETL on DataFrame (I know I did). I also wrote a post about SparkSQL Programming. However, we quickly learn that there’s more knowlege required to go from processing a few GBs of data to dealing with TBs and PBs of data, which is a challenge for big enterprises.</description>

      <description>You Spark job is running for a long time, what to do? Generally, long-running Spark jobs can be due to various factors. We like to call them the 5S - Spill, Skew, Shuffle, Storage, and Serialization. So, how do we identify the main culprit?
🔎 Look for Skew: Are some of the tasks taking longer than others? Do you have a join operation?
🔎 Look for Spill: Any out-of-memory errors? Do the executors have enough memory to finish their tasks?</description>

      <description>Choosing Enterprise Data Solution is a key challenge for modern businesses. With the explosion of data in recent years, organizations need to be able to store, manage, and analyze vast amounts of information to gain insights and make informed decisions. Data lakes, data warehouses, and data lakehouses are three popular solutions for managing data. However, Data Lakehouse has recently become a trend in distributed data management system
The battle: Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores structured, processed data from a variety of sources.</description>

      <title>How to recover lost files after a git reset --hard</title>

      <description>While working on a recent project, I accidentally committed some files. Instead of using git reset --soft &amp;lt;prev-commit-id&amp;gt; to unstage them, I used git reset --hard HEAD and all of my new changes gone with the wind. After panicking for a few minutes, I determined to learn how git reset works and how I can revert the damages.
1. What is git reset (hard vs soft) git reset --hard resets the current branch tip, and also deletes any changes in the working directory and staging area (although files under git stash will not be affected).</description>

      <description>As Dedicated SQL pool uses a scaled-out node based architecture, when creating tables in Dedicated SQL Pool, remember to specify the distribution (sharding strategy) and index for your tables.
Dedicated SQL Pool Architecture Choosing Distribution: The data is sharded into distributions to optimize the performance of the system. You can choose which sharding pattern to use to distribute the data when you define the table. These sharding patterns are supported:</description>
