  A girl who loves to Code and talk about Data

  I’m a self-taught developer who enjoy the ongoing pursuit of knowledge and technical skills. I'm an passionate hiker and camper. When I’m not programming, you can find me on the trails exploring nature, on the bike pedaling around lake Washington, or camping around Pacific Northwest.
