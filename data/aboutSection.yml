  ## About me 
  
  A girl who loves to Code and talk about Data

content: >
  I’m a self-taught developer who enjoy the ongoing pursuit of knowledge and technical skills. I can’t live without coffee and I love learning new things on my own. When I’m not programming, you can find me on the trails exploring nature, on the bike pedaling around lake Washington, or playing with new technologies
