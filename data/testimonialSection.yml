  ## What People Say About Me?

testimonial:

  - name: Kevin Marx, Principal Engineering Manager @ Microsoft
    comment: Anh is an amazing person and engineer. In her time on my team, she had immediate impact in moving critical projects forward. Anh was an engineering lead on Data Lake and analytics infrastructure projects, she quickly took charge and was able to work effectively with the various engineering and leadership stakeholders in the project to deliver a high-quality product. Anh would be a high-performing addition to any engineering team, and I cannot recommend her enough.

      comment: Anh is authentic and intuitive. I met Anh through Toastmasters when she transferred in from her college Toastmaster club to our corporate club. There, she willingly accepted an officer role, VP Membership, providing outreach and information to our guests. As she progressed through her Toastmaster speech assignments, I found her to be a strong storyteller with a great sense of humor. What most impressed me about Anh was her ability to define her goals and get there. Software is constantly evolving and Anh is not afraid to put in the work to stay ahead of the curve. I recommend Anh as an asset to any team.

  - name: Lana Baturyski, Senior Program Manager @ Microsoft
    comment: Anh is not afraid of challenges and ambiguity. Step by step she uncovered problems and managed to solve them. She tried varied approaches to get the best performance for Data Lakehouse. Anh amazes me by her ability to think outside the box and apply her curiosity outside the scope of her work. For example, when she works on the technical solution, she always aligns her work with business needs by collaborating with marketing, analytics and product. She truly own projects from knowing technology in and out and always writing documentation, scheduling follow up sessions and constantly improving.

    comment: Anh is an extremely hard-working, intelligent software & data engineer. In just 2 years, she went from being in supply-chain and having a business background to becoming a software engineer at Microsoft! Her deliverables are high-quality and I've seen her lead teams as well. Any company would be lucky to have her as an employee!

    comment: Anh is a accomplished professional who very quickly became a "go-to" member of a new team. Anh exhibits a tremendous combination of aptitude, team-work, work-ethic, professionalism, leadership, supply-chain knowledge and technical acumen. Anh took-on very critical tasks within the team and never disappointed, only over-achieved. I am 100% confident, that anyone can throw any task at her and she will deliver better-than-expected. I cannot recommend Anh enough.
