  ## What People Say About Me?

testimonial:
  - name: Kevin Marx, Principal Engineering Manager @ Microsoft
    comment: Anh is an amazing person and engineer. In her time on my team, she had immediate impact in moving critical projects forward. Anh was an engineering lead on Data Lake and analytics infrastructure projects, she quickly took charge and was able to work effectively with the various engineering and leadership stakeholders in the project to deliver a high-quality product. Anh would be a high-performing addition to any engineering team, and I cannot recommend her enough.

  - name: Omar Venado, Head of ML and backend services @ Microsoft
    comment: Anh is one of the most tenacious engineers I’ve worked with. A Big Data expert who is unafraid to challenge the status quo, break conventional boundaries, and raise the engineering standards. Anh is a creative thinker, team player, and one of those engineers that not only deliver results but uplift their entire team. As one of her mentors, any EM will be lucky to have Anh be part of their team.

  - name: Shaomeng Zhang, Principal Engineering Manager @ Microsoft
    comment: Anh is one of the most resourceful engineers I’ve worked with outside of my team, she came to us and redesigned our data syncing pipeline and migrated our analytics stack from AWS into a data lakehouse on Azure. She is not just knowledgeable about data engineering but also super curious about backend engineering and product making in general. Any team would be lucky to have her.

  - name: Lana Baturyski, Senior Program Manager @ Microsoft
    comment: Anh is not afraid of challenges and ambiguity. Step by step she uncovered problems and managed to solve them. She tried varied approaches to get the best performance for Data Lakehouse. Anh amazes me by her ability to think outside the box and apply her curiosity outside the scope of her work. For example, when she works on the technical solution, she always aligns her work with business needs by collaborating with marketing, analytics and product. She truly own projects from knowing technology in and out and always writing documentation, scheduling follow up sessions and constantly improving.

    comment: Anh is a accomplished professional who very quickly became a go-to member of a new team. Anh exhibits a tremendous combination of aptitude, team-work, work-ethic, professionalism, leadership, supply-chain knowledge and technical acumen. Anh took-on very critical tasks within the team and never disappointed, only over-achieved. I am 100% confident, that anyone can throw any task at her and she will deliver better-than-expected. I cannot recommend Anh enough.
